# Football Analytics Projects
Welcome to the Football Analytics Projects repository! This collection comprises personal data science and analytics projects focused on football. Below, you'll find details about the current projects and a glimpse into what's planned for the future.

## Current Projects
### 1. Match Simulator
- Objective:
Efficiently simulate the Premier League 2023/24 season by leveraging statistical insights derived from the initial 10 gameweeks.

- Features:
  - Utilizes Expected Goals (xG) data to simulate fixtures, providing a realistic representation of scoring opportunities.
  - Calculates Expected Points (xPts) based on the simulated outcomes, offering a comprehensive performance metric.
  - Capable of simulating individual matches to analyze specific encounters.
  - Extends functionality to simulate the entire Premier League 2023/24 season, allowing for a macroscopic view of team performance

- Future Additions:
  - Fixture Difficulty Integration: Enhance precision by incorporating fixture difficulty metrics, such as weighted Expected Goals (xG) and Expected Goals Against (xGA), refining the accuracy of diverse statistical calculations.
  - Randomness Generator: Introduce an additional layer of randomness per game to capture the inherent unpredictability of football matches.

## Future Projects
